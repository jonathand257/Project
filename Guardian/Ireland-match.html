          <p> Chris Coleman admitted his time as Wales manager might be coming to an end after the 1-0 win that put the Republic of Ireland into the World Cup play-offs and left his own team reflecting on an agonising end to their bid to qualify for the tournament for the first time since 1958.
Colemanâ€™s contract runs out next summer and he has previously indicated this would be his last qualifying programme in charge of the team he led to the Euro 2016 semi-finals.</p>
